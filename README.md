# Quantify

Quantify Research Referee audits factual company-analysis claims against a
declared, frozen evidence pool.

## Current deterministic foundation

The implemented engine accepts an immutable SEC evidence snapshot and typed
threshold or period-comparison claims. It provides:

- deterministic evidence selection under a named restatement policy;
- local-warrant and CE1 counterevidence analysis as separate audit outputs;
- final `verified`, `unsupported`, `defeated`, `qualified`, or agent-resolution
  verdict composition after disclosure assessment; and
- exact report-span and evidence-reference validation for future model output.

The offline `verify_report(...)` workflow connects those steps end to end for
frozen inputs. A provider-specific extractor may supply an `ExtractionResult`,
but it cannot bypass deterministic grounding, reference validation, or verdict
composition.
